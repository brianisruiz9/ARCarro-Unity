Hi! We're MindFluX, and we make art happen!

> You can use this in any of your games or apps (commercial or free) but do include us in the credits (as "MindFluX Studios" without the quotes)
> You may edit and/or re-distribute the model (but include this README file)
> Also, if you make an awesome game with any of our assets, drop a comment on the model page (Sketchfab) and mention your game (We'll add your game to a list on our site!)

Thanks, 
The MindFluX Team
